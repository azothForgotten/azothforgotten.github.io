	<h2>Game Description</h2>
	<p>Minesweeper has been around since the 1960s. Primarily played in times of absolute boredom, Minesweeper came bundled with Windows up until 7. The game is pretty simple. There are a number of cells, for beginners a 9x9 square is usually standard. Each cell is clickable and there several mines littered throughout the cells. The object is to click all of the cells that do not contain a mine, without ever clicking a mine. The cells immediately adjacent to a mine will have a number, indicating how many bombs that cell touches. It's a very simple game but it can get more complicated as you increase the number of bombs or cells.</p>
